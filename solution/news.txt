Former England football captain Jimmy Armfield has died from cancer at the age of 82, his club Blackpool FC confirmed.

Armfield was capped 43 times by England, 15 of them as captain, and made a club record 627 appearances for the Seasiders.

He later managed Bolton Wanderers and Leeds United, and was a BBC radio commentator for more than 35 years.

His family thanked well-wishers for their "messages of love and support".
